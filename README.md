# School/city library database program

This is my secondary school graduation project involving the school library and the city library.  
The interface managed by the end user is powered by Microsoft Access while the database itself could be migrated to a server solution if needed. The project is thus scalable and could be reused at a later date. This was adequate at the time, but of course, there are better solutions. (A C# solution maybe?)

*This is a rework of the original project so that I could learn Git in-depth. It is quite simplified from the original, but it may be updated accordingly.*

## Features

- [x] basic UI that's at least a bit pleasant to look at
- [x] some kind of security
- [x] more efficient way to check up on members and available books
- [x] all-around easier process when it comes to lending books
- [ ] ability to extract/print certain needed info
- [ ] ability to use the program on multiple computers at once
